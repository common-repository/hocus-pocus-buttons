Automagically show or don't show buttons/links for social bookmarking sites, depending on the sites the user has visited lately.

== Description ==

Hocus Pocus Buttons is a Wordpress-Plugin that provides sidebar widget with a widerange set of buttons for social bookmarking websites. However each button is only visible to the user if he has visited the corresponding site lately. 

The goal is not to disturb the user by using too many buttons / links (since he could probably only use one or two at all) and rather only show relevant services.

== Installation ==

* Unzip, upload to /wp-content/plugins/ folder
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
* In admin go to 'Themes', 'Widget' and drag new widget to desired position
